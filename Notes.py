##  Covering Basic Commands of Python

##! Variables
# assignment uses = 
# variables cannot start with a number, can't use ! or %. Also can't use keywords
name = 'Brendan'
age = 30

 ##! Expressions return values
 # 1+1 or 'Brendan'
 ## Statement is operation on a value
 ## A program is a series of statements
 # Can put multiple statements on one line separated by ; i.e., name = 'Tom'; print(name)

# Scope is defined by indentation

##! Data types
# Can check type with type(), i.e. print(type(name)) or isinstance, i.e.
# print(isinstance(name, str))
# String 'Brendan'
# Numbers - int and float print(isintance(variable, [int][float]))
# complex
# bool - boolean
# tuple - tuples
# range - ranges
# dict - dictionaries (objects(?))
# set - sets

# Can force type or cast/casting, i.e. age = float(2), name = int('20')

##! Operators
# = is assignment
# arithmatic operators +, -, *, /, %, ** (power), // (floor division rounds down)
